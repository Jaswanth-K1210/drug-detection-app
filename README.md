## ⚙️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Cleans and prepares raw dataset.
  - Feature selection and encoding.

- **Model Training**
  - Trains multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
  - Uses cross-validation for reliable accuracy measurement.

- **Evaluation**
  - Generates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Produces confusion matrix and performance visualizations.

- **Explainability**
  - Identifies key features contributing to predictions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaswanth-K1210/drug-detection-app.git
cd drug-detection-app/notebooks
````

### 2️⃣ Run the Notebook

You can open the notebook in:

* **Google Colab** → Upload `05_end_to_end_pipeline.ipynb`
* **Local Jupyter**:

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook 05_end_to_end_pipeline.ipynb
  ```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Typical requirements:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
